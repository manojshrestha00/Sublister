# Footprinting with Sublist3r

Sublist3r is a Python subdomain discovery tool that has been designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using data from publicly available sources and brute force techniques. The public sources consist of a wide range of popular search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, Ask and also Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster and ReverseDNS to discover subdomains.

You can also brute force subdomains using an integrated tool named Subbrute. Subbrute is a DNS meta-query spider that enumerates DNS records and subdomains by using an extensive wordlist. This tool uses open resolvers to avoid rate limiting issues that prevent Subbrute from completing the list or attempting all entries.
